# Various examples that can be run against a cockroach cluster in AWS.
# A cockroach cluster should be created first by following the steps in README.md.
# To enable an example, change the number of instances on the command line. eg:
# terraform apply <flags for cockroach cluster> --var=example_block_writer_instances=1

# Number of instances for the block writer example. Set to 1 to enable the example.
# The block writer example does not support multiple instances. Expect badness if
# set greater than 1.
